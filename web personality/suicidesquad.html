                <p class="textleftdescribe textcolor floatbanner"><img class="bannermargin floatbanner textpadding" src="suicidesquadpreview.png" alt="banner" width="500" height="700">In the one-year aftermath of Superman's death,[N 1] intelligence officer Amanda Waller convinces Washington, D.C. officials to allow her to assemble Task Force X, a team of dangerous criminals imprisoned at Belle Reve Special Security Barracks. The team consists of elite hitman Floyd Lawton / Deadshot, former psychiatrist Dr. Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn, pyrokinetic ex-gangster Chato Santana / El Diablo, opportunistic thief George "Digger" Harkness / Captain Boomerang, mutant Waylon Jones / Killer Croc, and mercenary Christopher Weiss / Slipknot. They are placed under command of Colonel Rick Flag to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the United States government. A nanite bomb is implanted in the neck of each team member, designed to be detonated should the member rebel or try to escape.
                    <br><br>
                    One of Waller's intended recruits is Flag's girlfriend Dr. June Moone, an archaeologist possessed by a demonic witch known as the "Enchantress". She quickly turns on Waller for imprisoning her, deciding to eradicate humankind with a mystical weapon. She besieges Midway City by transforming its populace into a horde of monsters, and summons her brother Incubus to assist her. Waller deploys the squad to extract a high-profile target from Midway, which is reported to be under a terrorist attack. Joining them is Katana, a Japanese swordswoman and Rick's bodyguard. Meanwhile, Harley's lover, Gotham City crime boss Joker, finds out about her predicament and tortures Belle Reve security officer Griggs into leading him to the facility where the nanite bombs are made. There, he blackmails Dr. Van Criss into disabling Harley's bomb.
                    <br><br>
                    Upon arrival in Midway City, the squad's helicopter is shot down, forcing them to proceed on foot to their target. Boomerang convinces Slipknot that the bombs are a ruse to keep them in check: the latter attempts to escape and is killed when Flag detonates his bomb. Meanwhile, the squad is ambushed by Enchantress' minions. They eventually fight their way through to a safe house, where they learn that their mark is Waller herself, who is attempting to cover up her involvement in Enchantress' siege. The squad escorts Waller to the rooftop for extraction, but the arriving helicopter has been hijacked by the Joker and his men, who open fire on the squad. Harley's bomb is disarmed by Dr. Van Criss, leaving Flag unable to execute her and allowing her to climb aboard the helicopter. Waller's men subsequently shoot down the helicopter, and Harley falls out while the Joker is presumed dead, after which Harley rejoins the squad. Alerted to Waller's whereabouts, Enchantress' minions arrive and kidnap her. Deadshot finds Waller's confidential files, from which he learns the truth about Enchantress, which Flag then is forced to confirm. This causes the squad members to abandon him. With Waller compromised, Flag relieves the squad of the mission but chooses to continue. Realizing they have an opportunity to prove themselves, the squad soon rejoin him and locate Enchantress at a partially-flooded subway station. Killer Croc and a group of Navy SEALs, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards, go underwater to plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and distracts Incubus long enough for the bomb to detonate underneath, killing them both as well as Edwards.
                    <br><br>
                    The remaining squad members battle Enchantress together but are ultimately defeated. Enchantress offers to fulfil their deepest desires in exchange for their allegiance, and Harley feigns interest in order to get close enough to cut out Enchantress' heart. Killer Croc then throws explosives into Enchantress' weapon and Deadshot shoots them, destroying the device. Flag crushes Enchantress' heart, finally freeing June from the curse. Waller, still alive, emerges, and the squad members are returned to Belle Reve with ten years off their sentences and (with the exception of Captain Boomerang) allowed special privileges. The Joker, alive and unscathed, breaks into the penitentiary and rescues Harley.
                    <br><br>
                    In a mid-credits scene, Waller meets with Bruce Wayne, who agrees to protect her from the backlash against her role in Enchantress' rampage in exchange for access to the government's files on the expanding metahuman community. This includes files on Barry Allen and Arthur Curry.</p>
